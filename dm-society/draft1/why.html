	<h1>Why you should hire us</h1>
		<p>Hiring a Dungeon Master for your game of <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> has only recently begun to take off around the world, and is still a strange idea to many players. There are a number of benefits though, both for experienced D&amp;D players and people who are new to the game.</p>
	<h2>New to D&amp;D</h2>
		<p>The best way to start playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons is with an experienced Dungeon Master to help you. We know the rules and have all the equipment to get started. Your Dungeon Master will tailor the game according to your group, making sure that you have a great first game. Even better, if someone in your wants to become a DM themselves, we would be happy to teach them along the way. Hire us for a great first experience of D&amp;D.
	<h2>Experienced players</h2>
		<p>You've never needed to hire a DM before now, so why start?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your DM wants to play as well</li>
				<li>You want a change of pace and style from your regular game</li>
				<li>You want to play with a DM that is dedicated solely to making it fun for the players, not telling their own story</li>
				<li>You don't have time to spend hours preparing for a session</li>
				<li>You'd prefer to play in your own place, not a public store</li>
				<li>You want somebody reliable and organised</li>
			</ul>
